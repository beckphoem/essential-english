## Sheriff Dan

Dan was the evil **sheriff** of Oceantown. Dan was as cruel as the **devil**. He **worshipped** money. Dan was a **millionaire**, but he paid his police officers almost nothing. The police were very **bitter**, but Dan didn’t care. He only cared about his money.

Every person who **inhabited** Oceantown disliked him. Dan **enforced** cruel laws. Once, Dan even put his own brother in jail for throwing a coin into a **fountain**! Sometimes he pointed his gun into the air and pulled the **trigger**. He didn’t want the **bullets** to hit anyone. He just wanted to scare people with the loud sound.

Finally, the people of Oceantown decided that they had to get rid of **Sheriff** Dan. With their understanding, the crowd sought to **unify** the town. They **marched** to Dan’s house. He was **startled** by the sight when he ran to the door. When he opened the door, the crowd jumped on him. They used a rope to tie him to a chair. Dan yelled, “ Get your hands off of me! I’ll put you all in jail for the rest of your lives!”

The crowd didn’t listen. They carried Dan to the **harbor** and put him **aboard** a **vessel**. Dan was so scared that he began to **sweat**. He begged, “ If you let me go, I will give you all my money!”

The crowd said back, “ **Sheriff**, we don’t care about your money. We know you will never change. We’re sending you on a **voyage** to the middle of the ocean.” The boat **drifted** out of the **port**, and Dan was never seen again. The people voted for a new **sheriff** who was kind and fair.
