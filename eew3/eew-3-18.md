## The Knight's Plan

A town was fighting for their **independence** from another country. Several **rebels** started a **revolution**. However, they were afraid of an **invasion** from a lot of **troops**. They didn’t have enough **warriors** to stop them, so they asked a **knight** for help.

![alt text](eew-3-18/21.png)

The **knight** made a plan. A tall mountain was outside the town. The road near the top was very narrow. **Cliffs** rose on both sides of it.

“ We must trick the enemy. They have to follow us up the mountain,” the **knight** explained. “ On the narrow path, only a few can attack us at one time.”

The people agreed with the **knight**’s plan.

![alt text](eew-3-18/22.png)

The **knight** put on his **armor**, and the **warriors** got their **spears**. When the enemy attacked, the **knight** and **warriors** acted as if they were afraid. They quickly **withdrew** toward the mountain.

![alt text](eew-3-18/23.png)

The enemy **troops** followed them up the **steep** path. Soon, the enemy became tired.

![alt text](eew-3-18/24.png)

At the **summit**, the **knight** and his **troops** stopped. The enemy was close behind them. But now they were tired. Also, only a few could attack because the path was narrow. The **knight** and the **warriors** fought the enemy. But there were too many **troops**.


![alt text](eew-3-18/25.png)


The **knight** was afraid. If the **warriors** **yielded** the path to the enemy, the town would be lost.



![alt text](eew-3-18/26.png)

A storm suddenly came over the mountain. There was strong wind and rain. **Thunder** **boomed**. **Lightning** struck some trees near the enemy. The trees **blazed**. The **flames** scared the enemy and they **retreated**. They ran down the mountain, out of the town, and never returned.


![alt text](eew-3-18/27.png)

The **knight** explained, “ With a little luck, a good plan beats even a big army.”
