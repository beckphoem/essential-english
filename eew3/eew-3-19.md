## THE MAGIC PEAR TREE

It was a cool morning, and the grass was covered in **mist**. The market was full of people. A mean farmer named Jack yelled, “ Pears for sale!” He sat on a **bench**, **plotting** how he could trick people. Then an **orphan** came to his cart.

![alt text](eew-3-19/21.png)

“ Can you spare a pear?” she asked.

Jack felt **rage**. He replied, “You don’t have any money!”

“ Please, I haven’t had **supper** in days.”

“ No!” shouted the farmer.

The **orphan** **sighed**. However, a **pregnant** lady heard the **dispute** and **confronted** Jack. “ Just give her a pear,” she said. Jack had no **shame** and said no. Finally, a man bought a pear for the girl.

The girl quickly ate it, but she saved the seed. She wanted to get **revenge**.

She told Jack, “ I know a way to get hundreds of pears in one day. I’ll show you how.”

He watched the girl dig a hole. She dropped the seed into the ground. Then she spread the dirt over it.

![alt text](eew-3-19/23.png)

“ Watch closely,” she said. “ In a few minutes, a **stem** will grow. It’ll turn into a tree that’s full of pears!”

Jack stared at the dirt, but nothing happened. The only **objects** there were a few **daisies**. He looked for the girl, but she had **snuck** away.

Then he looked at his cart in **horror**. It was empty! He suddenly realized that the **orphan** had tricked him. While Jack was waiting for the tree to grow, the people had taken the pears from his cart. They all laughed while they were eating the **tender** fruit. The farmer felt **ashamed**. The **incident** taught him to be kinder.
