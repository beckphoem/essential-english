## The boy who saved the town

Marcus lived in a small **suburb** near the sea. He was a **stubborn** boy, and he only cared about himself. His father worked as a **chemist** for an **institution** and wanted Marcus to get a job there. Instead, the boy delivered milk. Each morning he took **dairy** products to the **grocers**.

One day, Marcus was **jogging** down the street with a gallon of milk to give to a **merchant**. He didn’t want to be late. He ran down a path beside a large **canal**. A wall there kept water from coming into the town during high **tide**. But Marcus saw a small hole in the wall. Marcus knew that if the wall broke, it would be a **tragedy** for the town.

At first, he **hesitated**. He had to choose between helping himself and helping the town. There was only one way to save the town. It seemed crazy to him, but it was the only thing he could do. He **poked** his finger into the hole. This didn’t fix the problem forever, but it did **postpone** the **tragedy**.

His finger **ached**. He felt the **chill** of the **arctic** water as it **splashed** him. There was no one else around. He knew he had to wait until the **tide** **descended**. It was very difficult, but Marcus stayed there and saved the town.

Once the **tide** had **descended**, Marcus told everyone what happened. A group of people went to the wall. They saw the hole and fixed it. Everyone was very happy with Marcus. The local **congress** even gave him a gift for saving the town. He was a hero.
