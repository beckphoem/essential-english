## an interesting life

A man looked through some boxes with his grandson. They were filled with old photographs and objects that **portrayed** important events from the grandfather’s life. He wished to share the **circumstances** behind each event with his grandson.

The grandson, however, thought his grandfather’s stories were boring. The grandfather **coped** with this. He ignored his grandson’s **criticism**.

He took a photo from the box. “ That’s the **submarine** I was on during the war,” he explained. The grandson **gazed** at it.

The grandfather **glanced** at the next picture and **frowned**. It showed a row of **coffins**. His grandson noticed the **grief** in his grandfather’s face.

“ What is it?” the boy inquired.

“ This was after a **nuclear** **bomb** was dropped,” the grandfather answered. “ It **devastated** a city.”

Next the grandfather pulled a toy **microscope** from the box and **rotated** it in his hand.

“ Where did you get that?” the grandson asked.

“ This is a **souvenir** I bought at the science museum,” the grandfather said.

Now the boy was really interested. He started to understand that his grandfather was telling him a larger story. It was the story of his grandfather’s life.

He got another photo. It showed a young bride and **groom**. They were very happy. A **certificate** was attached to the photo. The boy couldn’t read it, but he **traced** his finger over paper.

“ What’s this from, Granddad?” he asked.

“ That’s my marriage **license** from the day I married your grandmother,” the grandfather said.

“ Wow!” said the boy. “ Granddad, now I know all about your life!”
