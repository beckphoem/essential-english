## LAZY HANS

![alt text](eew-3-23/21.png)

Hans was lazy. He **_seldom_** helped his mother with anything. He didn’t cook and he never **_mowed_** the **_lawn_**. He didn’t even **_shave_**! He spent the **_daytime_** **_gambling_** with his mother’s money. One day, his mother realized that her money was gone from her **_purse_**. “You’re **_banned_** from my house!” she shouted. “ Don’t come back until you’ve learned your lesson!”

![alt text](eew-3-23/22.png)

Hans went to live in the forest like an **_outlaw_**. But it was cold, and Hans couldn’t find food. He went to a **_cottage_** to ask for a meal.

![alt text](eew-3-23/23.png)

An **_Aborigine_** answered the door. “ Can I stay here please?” Hans asked.

“You can stay if you work,” the man replied.

![alt text](eew-3-23/24.png)

Hans liked the **_prospect_** of food and warmth, so he agreed.

The man pointed to a field. “ Take this **_rod_** and plant it over there. I am a **_wizard_**, and this magic **_rod_** will bring us food.”

![alt text](eew-3-23/25.png)

The field was far away. Hans knew it would be hard to walk there. So he just threw the **_rod_** behind the **_cottage_** and sat by the river. When daylight **_faded_**, he returned to the **_cottage_** and went to sleep.

![alt text](eew-3-23/26.png)

The next morning, the old man looked very **_fierce_**. “ You didn’t take the **_rod_** to the field!” he shouted.

“ No,” **_confessed_** Hans, “ it was too far!”

“ Because of you we have nothing to eat!” replied the man.

![alt text](eew-3-23/27.png)

Hans was **_terrified_** that the man would punish him. So he ran home. “ Mama!” he cried, “ I’m **_desperate_** to come back!” His mother was **_cautious_**.

“ Do you promise to work?” she asked.

“ Yes!” said Hans, “ I’ll never be lazy again!”
