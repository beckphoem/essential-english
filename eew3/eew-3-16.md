## Matthew learns a lesson

Matthew was a **sensible** boy. He always kept his room **tidy** and had a natural **literary** **aptitude**. One day, he hoped to have a career in **journalism**.

![alt text](eew-3-16/21.png)

One day, Matthew went to the **pharmacy** to pick up some **pills** for his grandmother. He saw some boys leaning against a pole outside. One of the boys **complimented** Matthew. “ I like your jacket.”

Another boy asked, “ Do you want to go to Nate’s Restaurant?”

“ Sure!” Matthew said.

![alt text](eew-3-16/22.png)

The boys walked to the restaurant. They were going to have **slices** of pizza. They ordered their food and drank soda with **straws**. They ate until their bellies **swelled** up. Matthew was having so much fun.

One of the boys said, “ Let’s leave without paying.”

![alt text](eew-3-16/23.png)

Suddenly, the waiter yelled, “ Stop!” The two other boys ran, leaving Matthew there alone.

Soon, the police arrived. “ Leaving without paying for your meal is the same as stealing,” said the police officer. “ The restaurant wants **justice**. So next week you have to go to court and let a **jury** decide your **punishment**.”

![alt text](eew-3-16/24.png)

When he went to court, the judge asked, “ Do you have anything to say, Matthew?”

He said, “ I feel **sorrow** for what I’ve done. Now I know that real friends won’t ask you to do something illegal.”

![alt text](eew-3-16/25.png)

The **jury** then let him have his **liberty**. But they made Matthew pick up trash as **punishment**.

Much to Matthew’s surprise, he ended up meeting some new friends.
