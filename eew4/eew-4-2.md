## MONKEY ISLAND

In the middle of the ocean, there is a small island shaped like an **arc**. Here, monkeys play on the beach and in the trees. But how did the monkeys get there?

Once, an English **admiral** was exploring Africa when he found hundreds of monkeys. The **admiral’s** **character** was mean. He thought, “I could sell these monkeys and become very rich! I’m going to take them to England.”

So the **admiral** set traps to catch the monkeys. He put **stakes** in the ground, tied **string** around them and made **loops** in the **string**. When the monkeys ran through the forest, their feet got caught in the **loops**, and they couldn’t escape. Then the **admiral** put the monkeys in cages on his ship and sailed away.

The cages were small and uncomfortable. There was no soft **hay** for the monkeys to sleep on. Instead, they slept on branches with sharp **thorns** that cut into the monkeys’ **flesh**. For dinner, he gave them tiny pieces of **sour** **grapefruit** to eat. The monkeys grew hungry and weak.

But one day, the **admiral** hired a new **steward**. He was a kind man with a good **conscience**. He was **horrified** to see the thin monkeys in the cages. So one night he let them out.

The monkeys ran and played all over the ship! They attacked the **admiral** and the **steward** and ate their food. They completely **wrecked** the ship. One monkey ran into a **kerosene** lamp, and it fell over. The ship caught fire and began to sink! The whole crew was lost except for the monkeys.

After the **accident**, the monkeys jumped onto a **raft**. They floated away from the **fiery** blaze of the ship. In the morning, they saw a little island in the distance. The monkeys used a piece of wood as a **paddle**, and they went toward it. They found the island shaped like an **arc**. They felt so happy to find a new home, and they still live there today.
