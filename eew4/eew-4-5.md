## THE MAGIC COMPUTER

I had a difficult geography project to finish by the end of the **semester**. My teacher wanted it to be **typewritten**, so I went to the school computer room. But when I got there, all the computers were turned off. Apparently there was a **recent** problem, and technicians were fixing it.

I knew of some **private** study rooms downstairs. They were small and dark, and the computers were very old, but I had no choice. At least the computers were **operating** correctly. I typed and **highlighted** the assignment’s title: “**Evaluate** the Government’s Response to **Global** Warming.” But I didn’t know what to write in my **essay**. Finally I decided to find a book to help me. I went to the library, checked the book **indexes** and eventually found a useful book. Then I returned to the computer.

When I looked at the screen, I saw something so **weird** that I nearly **fainted**! The **essay** was complete! Had somebody in **cyberspace** written it? I didn’t know, but I was very happy. I printed it out and handed it in. I got an “A.”

After that, I used the computer for all my assignments. I’d type the title, wait **awhile**, and the computer would do it. Every assignment was perfect; I never had to **edit** anything. I stopped paying attention to my teacher’s **lectures** and spent my extra time in the **gymnasium**. And my grades got better and better.

A month later, I was walking into class when my friend said, “Are you prepared for the test?”

“What test?” I asked.

“The geography test!” he replied. “I hope you studied. It’s worth seventy percent of our final grade!”

I failed the test, of course. I was completely **ignorant** about the subject. After that, I made a **resolution** never to use the magic computer again. The **moral** of this story is that if you cheat at school, you won’t learn anything.
