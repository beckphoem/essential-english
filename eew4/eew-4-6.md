## JACK FROST AND THE PUDDING

Every winter, a magical boy with a wild **spirit** named Jack Frost arrives in town. He wears a white **cape**, and his **role** is to cover everything with frost and ice. But Jack Frost also gets **pleasure** from playing tricks on common **folk**.

One dark winter evening, he was sitting on the **rail** of a fence near a river, pointing at some trees. When he did so, there was a **pop**, and the trees were **evenly** covered in frost.

Then old Tom Muggins came along the path. He was carrying a basket of ingredients for his wife’s cake **recipe**. “I’ll have some fun with him!” said Jack Frost. He pointed, and suddenly there was a **patch** of ice on the path. Poor Tom slipped and fell into the river. The bags of flour, fruit and sugar fell open and got wet. A couple of eggs broke, and a stick of butter **shrank** in the water. Tom gathered the ingredients and climbed out of the river. The food made an **absolute** mess of the path. “**Alas**!” he cried. “There’ll be no cake for me!”

Jack Frost laughed at poor Tom because his nice **suit** got **soaked** as well. “Are you cold?” he said. “Don’t worry, I’ll make you warm!” He pointed at the mess in Tom’s basket. Suddenly, there was a **spark**. What was left of the food caught fire! Jack Frost ran off laughing.

Poor Tom sat by the fire. He could only **envision** how angry his wife would be. He wished he had been more **attentive** and noticed that Jack was around.

Suddenly, a pleasant smell came from the basket. Tom looked inside. The butter was **melting** and the eggs were starting to cook! Even the fruit began to simmer. Soon there was a fat, brown **pudding** in the basket! Tom tasted it. It was delicious! He happily took it home for dessert. Although Jack Frost had tried to make Tom’s life difficult, Jack had actually made Tom a wonderful **pudding**!
