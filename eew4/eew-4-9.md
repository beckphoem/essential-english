## GROWING TO BE GREAT

When George was just a boy, the **rumor** was that his parents died in a car accident. Many bad things could have happened to George, but he was lucky. He was sent to live **alongside** other children without parents. There were kind people to **assist** George and help him go forward with his life. However, he was a **pessimistic** and mean little boy.

George was often **outraged**. He told mean **rumor**s about the other kids. He **smash**ed furniture and even **slap**ped other boys. He **defy**ied anyone who tried to help him, and soon it was difficult for them to **forgive** him. But George did **display** a love for one thing. He loved to play baseball. **Whereas** he was lazy in school and liked neither the **subject**s **nor** the teachers, he was **lively** and happy when he played baseball.

One of George’s teachers noticed his talent. He began to work with the boy. At first they only talked about baseball. The teacher watched George play. He was a very **efficient** hitter. He almost never missed the ball. The teacher thought that George looked **majestic** when he played. When George hit the ball, it flew through the **breeze** as if it would never come down. In time, they began to talk about other things. They talked about George’s family and his dreams for the future. They developed a very good relationship.

As George got older, he began to grow. His **appetite** was huge. He ate and ate. He got stronger. Soon the other boys and even the teachers looked small and **feeble** next to him. Everyone thought that this heralded the start of a great baseball career.

When George got his first job as a baseball player, he gave most of his **wage**s to the people who had helped him as a boy. He hoped that other children would also find a way to live happy, successful lives.
