## THE YOUNG MAN AND THE OLD MAN

A proud young man was looking for a new **pastime**. He heard about people hiking in the national parks and decided to try it for himself. As he started his stroll, an old man walked up to him.

“Don’t go this way,” the old man said. “**Beware**. The paths are not clear. It’s easy to become lost.”

But the young man **disagreed** with the old man and **bragged** that he had a **perfect** understanding of the park. “I studied maps of this area,” he told him. “I believe I have a **thorough** knowledge of these trails. I won’t become lost.”

The old man listened to the young man and then **admonished** him for his pride.

“I have walked these trails my entire life,” he said. “If you think you will be safe, then go ahead.”

The young man ignored the old man and started along the trail.

Whenever he had to choose between an easy or difficult route, he always chose the more difficult **option**. In addition, he was not **conscious** of which direction he was going. After a while, he decided to return home. Because his course through the wilderness was so **indirect**, he had no idea where he was.

He looked at his map but could not **pinpoint** his location. He walked one path after another but soon realized he was lost.

The sun was going down, and sudden strong winds gave a **hint** that it might rain. **Immense** clouds filled the sky. **Awesome** sounds of thunder were **audible** from all directions. It **echoed** off the mountains. The thought of the **eventual** storm **tormented** the young man. He hurried in one direction, but soon **switched** out of confusion. Luckily, it led him out of the park.

When he arrived home, he knew that he had acted like an **idiot**. He realized he was lucky to be alive. He decided to listen to people with more experience than himself.
