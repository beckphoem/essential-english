## THE TRICKY FOX

There was a fox that lived in the forest. Fox loved to play mean tricks on the other animals. One day, he used the sharp **rim** of a bottle to dig a **pit** in the ground. He hid in a tree until Rabbit came to the **pit’s** edge. Then, he jumped out and pushed Rabbit into the **pit**. Fox laughed and ran away. The angry Rabbit climbed out and told the other animals what happened.

The others said, “That is **typical** behavior for Fox. He does mean things all the time. Sometimes, he is completely **immoral**. We all **disapprove** of his actions, so we should teach him a lesson. Tomorrow, we’ll push Fox into that **pit**.”

The next day, all of the animals hid near the **pit** and waited for Fox. Fox was **oblivious** to the hidden animals. He walked up to the **pit** to see if Rabbit was still trapped. Just then, the other animals ran up to Fox and pushed him in. All the animals laughed and cheered, **except** Fox, of course.

Fox couldn’t get out! The walls of the **pit** were covered in **damp** **ivy**. It was too **slippery** for him to climb out. He was **utterly** helpless. He **moaned** and began to **weep**.

At last, he saw Eagle watching him from her **roost**. He yelled, “Eagle, please help me! If I don’t get out of here, I will **perish**!”

Eagle said, “You may think your tricks are **trivial**, but you hurt others when you do mean things. I’ll help you if you promise to be nice.”

Fox said, “I promise!”

Eagle began her **flight** to the bottom of the **pit**. She picked up Fox with her **beak** and **soared** out of the **pit**. She dropped Fox safely on the ground.

Fox thanked Eagle and kept his promise. He was nice to the other animals. The animals even became **fond** of Fox, and the forest was happy place.
