## JANIE AND THE MUSIC PLAYER

Janie had **constant** thoughts about getting a music player. One day, she was late to class. She hurried down the hall but **halted** when she saw a backpack on the floor. She looked inside and found nothing but some books. She reached inside the bag and felt a small object at the bottom. It was a music player **enclosed** in a black case! Janie **tended** to be honest, and she had no **valid** reason to take the **device**. However, her desire for the player **influenced** her decision. Janie was being **sly**. She put the **device** into her own backpack. When she arrived at class, she gave her teacher the bag. “I found this,” she said.

Ms. Johnson asked, “Does this backpack belong to anyone?” A girl named Linda claimed the bag. Linda looked inside and yelled, “My music player is missing! Janie took it!” Janie answered, “I did not.” Linda responded, “You were the only one that had **access** to it! If your **version** of the story is true, you’ll let Ms. Johnson check your bag.” Janie started to **perspire** as she realized the **impending** trouble she was in. She **gripped** her bag tightly.

Ms. Johnson took the bag from Janie. Inside she found the player. “Janie, I never expected this kind of **conduct** from you,” she said. “You’ve always been such a good student.”

Ms. Johnson gave Linda the player. Linda said, “Ms. Johnson, look!” There was a **crack** along one side. She turned it to the “on” **mode**, but it wouldn’t work. It must’ve **snapped** while Janie was holding onto the bag so tightly.

Ms. Johnson called Janie’s parents. They were very upset. “Stealing is illegal. You have no respect for the **law** **whatsoever**,” they said. “We bought you a music player, but we’re giving it to Linda. It will **replace** the one you broke.” In the end, Janie’s bad behavior left her with nothing at all.
