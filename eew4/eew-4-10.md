## Anton’s Great Discovery

Anton Van Leeuwenhoek was a Dutch cloth merchant. His life began to change after he got his first microscope in 1653. It was a very simple microscope. It had a lens in an **upright** stand. It could make small things look large. It was **handy** for looking closely at cloth.

Soon, Anton felt a **longing** to build a more powerful microscope. He dreamed of using it to make an important scientific discovery. He wanted to become famous. Three **decades** later, he did.

For many years, Anton experimented with microscopes and lenses. Eventually he **constructed** a very powerful microscope. If he had sold the **concept** to others, it would have made him very rich. However, Anton **refrained** from **surrendering** his secret to anyone. Instead, he wanted to use it to become famous. So he used his secret microscope to study the natural world.

One day he was looking at saliva from his mouth with the microscope. In the saliva, he saw **numerous** tiny **particles**. Some of them were moving! He thought that the **particles** were tiny organisms. So he **isolated** them from each other and studied each one carefully. Then he **classified** them into different categories. Some were round. Others were long and had tails. All were alive.

Anton was so excited. He knew he could become famous now. He was the first person to see these tiny organisms. So he drew **diagrams** of the organisms and sent them to a group of scientists in London. The scientists were **sophisticated** men who did not believe tiny, **animate** organisms could live in our mouths. Anton made a **plea** for them to come to Holland to see the organisms with their own eyes. The men took a **ferry** to Holland and met Anton. They performed a careful **review** of his work, and they **conceded** that he had made a **worthwhile** discovery. Anton Van Leeuwenhoek had discovered bacteria. After **decades** of hard work, he had become famous.
