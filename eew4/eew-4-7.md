## THE ARCHITECT'S PLAN

An **architect** wanted to build a new office building. He selected some land that seemed perfect. He planned to cut down the trees to make room for the building. But there was a problem ... a big problem.

The land was actually the **habitat** of several types of birds. Some nature lovers were very upset with the **architect**. First, they held a **rally** and told others about the issue. Then, they decided to take **legal** action because the **architect** didn’t respect the animals’ rights.

To **resolve** the problem, they asked a judge to **intervene**.

The judge could not call any **witnesses** for the nature lovers, so he first asked the **architect** to tell his side of the story.

“Why are you going to destroy the birds’ **habitat**?” the judge asked.

The **architect** replied, “I have the **deed** to the land. I want to make a great building there. As you may know, all my buildings become **memorable** **landmarks**.”

Then one of the nature lovers spoke. “We believe that there’s no reason to destroy all the trees. We just want to protect the birds.”

Then the judge made his decision. “I **proclaim** that the office building should be built,” he said. “It is not a **crime** to remove those trees. I cannot give you a **sentence** for any **offenses**, but I feel **obliged** to make one request. I will only allow you to use half of the land. The other half will remain free, so the birds have a place to live.

The nature lovers could not **conceal** their **gratitude**. All of the people cheered.

The **architect** said, “I have an idea. I will **volunteer** my time and efforts to design a new type of building. It will provide bushes on the roof where birds can live. There are enough **resources** in my company’s bank **account** to create the best building ever made.”

The **architect** did exactly as he promised. He built this new type of building, which was loved by everyone.
