## How Did Greenland Get Its Name?

The nation of Greenland isn’t very green. The sun’s **rays** don’t shine there for three whole months. As a result, it’s covered with snow, ice and **frost**. Then how was the name **derived**? It started with a Viking named Erik the Red. Erik had many **merits**. However, there was an **underlying** problem . . . he got angry easily. People were scared of him. However, he was married to the niece of a very powerful man. So everybody tried to be nice to him.

![alt text](eew-3-25/21.png)

One day, Erik fought with his neighbor and killed him. His **consequent** punishment was to leave Iceland.

Many stories **circulated** about a land west of Iceland. But only a **fraction** of the people in Iceland believed them. Still, Erik wanted to find it.

![alt text](eew-3-25/22.png)

Erik sailed toward the land **via** the Atlantic Ocean. His **marine** knowledge was good, but the trip was hard. Some of his men **drowned**. Erik’s **lieutenant** wanted to **resign** from his position. Others thought about committing **suicide**.

![alt text](eew-3-25/23.png)

Suddenly, Erik thought he saw something. “ I don’t believe it,” said Erik. “ It must be an **illusion**.” But it was no trick—it was the new land!

![alt text](eew-3-25/24.png)

Erik **trembled** in the cold **polar** air. He saw that there was ice everywhere. He realized that the ice could keep enemies out. Not even the best **navy** could **invade** the new land. He could start a new **dynasty** in his name. But how could he convince people to live here?

![alt text](eew-3-25/25.png)

“ I’ll call it ‘Greenland,’” he said. Erik’s plan worked Within two years, over a thousand people moved to Greenland. In the end, Greenland got its name all because of a trick.
