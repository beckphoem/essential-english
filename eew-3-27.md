## Pizarro and the inca gold

According to **rumors**, there’s lots of **precious** gold hidden in the jungles of Peru. It got there when the Spanish **conquered** parts of South America. The Spanish **noble**, Francisco Pizarro, arrived in Peru in the 1500s. He found a group of people called the Incas. The Incas believed that their leader, Atahualpa, was both a king and a god. But Pizarro didn’t agree.

“ It is a **sin** for a man to think he is God!” he said to Atahualpa.

Atahualpa thought Pizarro was **insulting** his **heritage**. He thought the **blonde** Spanish men held **prejudices** against the Incas. But Atahualpa was a kind man and didn’t want to fight the Spaniards. He said, “ If I give you a room full of gold, will you leave my country in peace?”

Pizarro was **suspicious**. He thought Atahualpa was **exaggerating**. But a few days later, Pizarro returned to the Inca palace with his **ambassadors**. He saw a room filled with **stacks** of gold. There were golden **necklaces**, cups, plates and **vases**. It was a great **spectacle**. He **acknowledged** that Atahualpa had told the truth. But after seeing the gold, he wanted all of Peru’s gold. So he didn’t leave the country.

The Spanish soldiers stayed in Peru and grabbed all the gold they could find. But the Inca people tricked the Spaniards. They mixed the gold with **tin** so that it was poor quality. They gave this gold to the Spaniards. **Meanwhile**, they hid the good gold. They stuffed it into sacks and **dragged** it deep into the jungle. The Spanish **conquerors** never found the gold. People think it is still there today.
