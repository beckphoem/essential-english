## The Magic Cup

Paul and John were brothers. They fought all the time because they both wanted to be leaders of the **agency** they both worked at.

There was a **superstition** in their town about a magic cup. People said the cup was in a volcano located far away. Anyone who **retrieved** the cup would have their wish come true. John and Paul both wanted to find it. Then they could become the leader.

They both left to find the cup. Before their trip, their mother said they should work together. They **dismissed** that idea. Even though their trips **originated** from the same house, each wanted to travel alone.

They were both **miserable** during the trip. They had to **navigate** small boats across **shallow** rivers and climb difficult **slopes**. Their journey **spanned** many days. When they finally got close to the volcano, the ground began to **vibrate** and the volcano **erupted**. **Ash** filled the sky and **lava** covered everything. John climbed to the top of a hill to keep from getting burned. A few moments later, his brother went up the same hill. They were **confined** to the hill until the **lava** cooled down.

They talked about the things they had seen while **wandering** around the country. They felt more **sympathy** and **affection** for each other than ever before. They decided that **fate** had brought them together.

The next day they left to finish the **remainder** of the trip together. Everything seemed much easier. When they finally found the cup, they learned that it didn’t make wishes come true. It was only an ordinary cup. But the trip to reach the cup taught them to work together and love each other.
