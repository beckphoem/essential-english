## THE KITTEN AND THE CATERPILLAR

Katie the kitten liked to play. One day, Cory the **_caterpillar_** **_emerged_** from a hole in the wall while Katie was playing in the living room.

“ Hey!” Katie yelled. “ Do you want to play with me?”

Cory was **_reluctant_**. He said, “ I’d rather not play with you. I have several **_handicaps_**. My body is very **_delicate_**. Your claws are as sharp as **_hooks_**. You might cut me. Plus, I have no bones, not even a **_spine_**. You could easily hurt me.”

“ I **_swear_** that I won’t hurt you,” Katie said.

“ No, I don’t want to,” he said again. He **_hopped_** from the wall, but Katie **_pursued_** him.

Cory ran into the kitchen and into the **_cupboard_**, but Katie chased closely behind. Katie knocked **_appliances_** to the floor. Plates fell into the sink and broke in the **_basin_**.

Then he ran into a bedroom. Some **_laundry_** was on the floor. Cory hid under a shirt, but Katie saw him. She jumped on the shirt. Her paws left **_stains_** on the cloth, and her claws ripped the **_sleeves_** into **_strips_**.

However, Cory escaped. He **_utilized_** a small crack in the floor to hide. But Katie saw him.

“ Now you are trapped!” said Katie.

Cory tried to avoid Katie’s claws. He moved his body as far into the hole as possible. He didn’t know how he’d get out of the hole.

Just then, Katie’s owner came home. She saw that the house was a mess. She took a **_broom_** and **_swung_** it at Katie. She chased Katie out of the house.

Cory was safe, and Katie was left outside because she didn’t listen to the wishes of others.
