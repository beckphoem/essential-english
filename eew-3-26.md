## Everyone is Special

When I was young, everything that went wrong in my house seemed to be my fault. Once, my brothers tried to make cookies. They **blended** **flour** and **ginger** and made a **disgusting** **paste**. Then they tried to wash it down the **drain**, but it got all over the floor. Later, my brothers said that I did it and I had to **wipe** it up.

![alt text](eew-3-26/21.png)

I worried that my parents liked them more than me. One **autumn** day, I was sure I would make my parents proud. I bought a model rocket. After I put it together, I invited everybody to watch it. I wanted my brothers to **envy** my technical knowledge. I lit the **fuse**, but nothing happened.

![alt text](eew-3-26/22.png)

“ Looks like your **fireworks** don’t work. I hope you kept the **receipt** so you can return them,” my brother said.

“ It’s not **fireworks**!” I screamed. They were making fun of me again.

![alt text](eew-3-26/23.png)

I didn’t know what went wrong. I hadn’t **altered** anything. I quickly moved the **wires** on the bottom, hoping that would help. Suddenly, the rocket flew up. We stood **aside** as it **curved** through the lawn and ran straight into the mailbox. Then the mailbox **collapsed**. The rocket was **crushed**.

![alt text](eew-3-26/24.png)

Embarrassed, I ran inside and hid. A few minutes later, my mom asked, “ Are you OK?”

![alt text](eew-3-26/25.png)

“ I just wanted them to be **jealous** of me for once. Now I see why you and Dad don’t love me as much as them,” I said.

![alt text](eew-3-26/26.png)

“ That’s not true!” said my mom. “ See my fingers . . . each one is different. You kids are like my fingers: all are different, but I love them all the same.”

I **embraced** her. Now I know that my parents love me just as much as my brothers.
