## Why monkey has no home

For five years, there was a **famine**. The farmers asked people to **bless** them and finally, they had a good **harvest**. Since there was now plenty of food, the **pharaoh** decided to have a party. The party was a happy **affair**. For five days they had a huge feast.

Monkey was very happy. Because of the **famine**, he was very **slim**. He wanted to eat a lot of food.

When he arrived at the feast, hundreds of long tables were filled with food. There were **nuts**, bowls of **cereal**, and **ripe** fruit. He could also smell hot **roasted** meat cooking on the **stove**.

The **assembly** of animals was **merry**. However, during the feast, Monkey thought of a **scheme** to **exploit** the **pharaoh**’s kindness. He decided to steal some of the food and then eat it at home.

All the animals were **cheerful**. They didn’t notice that monkey was hiding food. After the feast, Monkey took the food to his house and ate it. He repeated this **routine** every day for four days.

But on the fifth day, the **pharaoh** had a surprise. He was going to give all the animals a home. Monkey was very excited. But when he arrived at the **pharaoh**’s home, he could not get through the door. The **diameter** of his waist was wider than the doorway. He was too fat!

Monkey asked the **pharaoh** to forgive him for his **theft**. But the **pharaoh** said no. “**Pardon**?” asked the monkey. He didn’t understand why the **pharaoh** was being unkind.

“ Everybody else will have a home now, but not you. Now you know that greed gets you nothing,” explained the **pharaoh**.
