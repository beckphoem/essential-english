## THE OLD MAN WITH A BUMP

An old man had a large bump on his face. He went to the best **physician** in town. He gave the old man **tragic** news: “ I can’t do anything. You’ll have to get **accustomed** to it.”

One day, the old man went into the forest. Suddenly, the light became **dim**. It was going to rain. So he found a **hollow** tree to sit under. It **leaked** a little, but there was no other place he could wait.

When the rain stopped, his **joints** felt **stiff** from sitting. Suddenly, he heard a **tune** coming from far away. Many **fables** said monsters lived in the forest. No one could **affirm** that the stories were true, though. Still, his **instincts** told him that there was something out there. He walked farther into the forest. Then he saw a fire **glowing**. He was **astonished** to see a **clan** of monsters. They were having a great **feast** and **banging** on drums.

He stood behind a tree, spying on them. Then the leader asked, “ Who’s the best dancer here?”

“ Me!” the man yelled, coming from behind the tree. He started to dance. When he was finished, the leader said, “ I want you to dance every night. In order to make sure you return, I’m going to keep something you love.”

“ Please don’t take my bump,” he begged. “ I can’t **sacrifice** it. It’s good luck!” He exclaimed, pointing at it for **emphasis**.

The monsters agreed that they had to take his bump. After they did, the man **stroked** his face to make sure it was gone. He had tricked them! He never went back, and he never had to worry about his bump again.
