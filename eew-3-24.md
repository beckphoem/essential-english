## THE BREMEN TOWN MUSICIANS

Larry the cow, Harry the rooster and Lester the duck lived on a **widow’s** farm. They dreamed of playing music in a **parade**.

One day, the **widow** went to the lawn where her **herd** of **cattle** was **grazing**. “ I’ll eat him tomorrow,” she said, pointing to Larry.

![alt text](eew-3-24/21.png)

Larry wanted to **flee**, but he didn’t have the **nerve** to go by himself. Then his friends Lester and Harry showed him a **poster**.

“ It’s for a **parade** in Bremen. We’ll go with you, and we can perform our **symphony** there,” Lester said.

The animals put together a small **bundle** that held a drum, a flute and a **portable** microphone. Then they took their **baggage** and **initiated** their long journey.

![alt text](eew-3-24/22.png)

They walked down a **paved** **lane** all day. That night, they looked in the window of a house. They saw a group of thieves. They were eating a large dinner and telling stories about their **greed** and the people they stole from.

Lester was an **optimist**. He said, “ I think we can scare them away!”

Soon, the animals came up with a plan. Harry flew inside and knocked over the lamp. “ What was that?” screamed a thief as the **bulb** broke. They could barely see now.

Then Larry stood on two feet, and Lester flew to the top of his head. They looked very big. All three of the animals made scary noises. The thieves tried to hit the animals. But Harry flew over them and **scratched** them.

“ It’s a **phantom**!” yelled one thief.

The thieves ran away. The animals ate and rested. The next morning, Larry said, “Why go to Bremen? We can stay here and make music!” And so they remained there and were quite happy.
